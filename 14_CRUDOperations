Summary - 
1) we put a fetchItems function 
using an async await anonymous function
and the fetch API
inside of the useEffect Hook
in our App component
and this functional App component is the parent component 
for the rest of the components in our application
2) we simulated a call to an API using a 2 second setTimeout
but we are really running a local JSON server instance
and we are accessing the data from our db.json file.

So we have this code.
We request the data from the API 
Now we need to link up the rest of the CRUD operations
Create for creating a listItem
Read for reading a listItem
Update for updating a listItem
Delete for deleting a listItem

  useEffect(() => {

    // CRUD - Read
    const fetchItems = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(API_URL);
	if (!response.ok) throw Error('Did not receive expected data');
        const listItems = await response.json();
        // console.log(listItems);		// can delete was useful for debugging
        setItems(listItems);
        setFetchError(null)
      } catch (err) {
        // console.log(err.message)		// can delete was useful for debugging
        setFetchError(err.message);
      }	finally {
	setIsLoading(false)
      }
    }
    setTimeout(() => {
      (async () => await fetchItems())();	
    }, 2000)

  }, [])


So lets go ahead and put CrUD in place as well. (r is done).

App.js

import Header from './Header';
import SearchItem from './SearchItem';
import AddItem from './AddItem';
import Content from './Content';
import Footer from './Footer';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3500/items';

  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [newItem, setNewItem] = useState('');
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
  const [fetchError, setFetchError] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

Need add a file to the src folder   	apiRequest.js
this will contain a function that we can import to use
for all of these other operations (Create, Update, Delete)
so here we abstract somewhat to allow us to us this 1 function
for all 3 operations

define the name const apiRequest
it will be an asyc function
that accepts a url
we will use a default parameter for now that is just an empty string
then it is going to accept a 2nd parameter 
called an optionsObject
and this optionsOjb will be set to null 	= null
this will have a 3rd parameter errMsg
and this will be set to null
the we put in the arrow for the arrow function and curly braces {}
and we also need to remember to export this function so at the bottom
we add export default apiRequest;

const apiRequest = 
const apiRequest = async ()
const apiRequest = async (url = )
const apiRequest = async (url = '')
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj)
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null)
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = )
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null)
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
}
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
}

export default apiRequest;


now with the setup done, lets start the component's body
we start with a try block 		try {}
and the setup inside the try block would also include a catch {}
for an error			(err)
and then it will have a finally at the end that happens whether we
have an error or not.


const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {}
}

export default apiRequest;


const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {}

    catch ()
}


const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {}

    catch (err) {}
}

const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {
    
    } catch (err) {

    } finally {

    }
}

export default apiRequest;


now we have our try catch finally block, lets define the generic requests
which defines the response we expect to receive inside the try block
we set that equal to await fetch
and we use the url here
and fetch also accepts a 2nd parameter which is an optionsObj
this optionsObj is the 2nd parameter that was originally part of the apiRequest function
so we accept both of those 		;
Note that the optionsObj is what differentiates this addressing which amoung the choices of
Create vs Update vs Delete request.

        const response
        const response = await
        const response = await fetch
        const response = await fetch(url,
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj)
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);

so now we have 

const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);
    
    } catch (err) {

    } finally {

    }
}

export default apiRequest;



after the const response statement, we check to see if
the url response is ok or not.
This is a lot like our fetch function from the useEffect of the App component.
This is say !response.ok (ie if the response is not correct) then we want to catch it
and throw an Error b/c this will not be automatically caught as a error (ie its a
response that we did not want)
and so here we add the text 'Please reload the app'
We add this text b/c at this point the state of the application may not be in sync
with the database. So we reload, get the data back from the server once again, and then
our state will be updated once again to be in sync with the server.
So this is why we add the 'Please reload' message here.


        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);
	if (!response.ok)    
	if (!response.ok) throw 
	if (!response.ok) throw Error()
	if (!response.ok) throw Error('Please reload the app);

so now we have 

const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);
	if (!response.ok) throw Error('Please reload the app);    
    } catch (err) {

    } finally {

    }
}

export default apiRequest;


then we need to define the error message in the catch block
we set the error message equal to 		=
err.message

         errMsg
         errMsg = 
         errMsg = err.message;

and then in the finally block, this is where we
want to return the error message
so no matter what, this return will happen whether the
message is null or it actually has a value
and we dont need a response back from the API here		if (!response.ok) throw Error('Please reload the app);    
and the reason we dont need those reponses back is b/c
we are updating the state with our setItems and other set functions
that we would call from our state, however, that does not update the API
and we need to keep the state of our application and the API in sync  v03.50.26
but we can update the state and see that update occur faster 
than we may get that response back from the API 
so we dont want to wait for that response 
we would rather instantly show the new state in the application 
but then if we get an error message then we know we are out of sync
with the API so then we show 'Please reload the app' message
(or whatever other error might occur that is caught by the catch (err) block

         return errMsg;

so now we have our apiRequest

const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);
	if (!response.ok) throw Error('Please reload the app);    
    } catch (err) {
         errMsg = err.message;
    } finally {
         return errMsg;
    }
}

export default apiRequest;


now lets go back to the App component and import our apiRequest
so we import apiRequest from apiRequest

App.js

import Header from './Header';
import SearchItem from './SearchItem';
import AddItem from './AddItem';
import Content from './Content';
import Footer from './Footer';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import apiRequest from './apiRequest';

so far we have
1) defined the apiRequest
2) imported into our App.js component
3) now we need to put the apiRequest to work and the first place we
could use it is within the addItem function
