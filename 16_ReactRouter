ReactJS Blog is like a full website
React helps to create SPAs (Single Page Applications)

Lets PREVIEW this project:
This offers a home page, with the feed that has different blog posts, 
we have a page for new posts, 
we have an about page, 
and if we go back to the feed we can click on any blog post
and get a page with the full post and the ability to delete the post 
We accomplish all of this with React Router 
And notice that as click on the different pages, the url does change 
however these pages are not requested from the server 
These are components that routed using React Router and therefor you
get an almost instanteous response which is also an excellent user experience.

For VSCode, the file tree shows in the src folder
src folder 	App.js
		index.css
		index.js
.gitignore
package-loc...
package.json
README.md

Terminal
$ npx create-react-app THEN_NAME_THE_FOLDERTOCREATE
$ npx create-react-app 16tut
enter

use VSCode to open the folder you created
then once you in the folder, you need to add one more dependency 
which is the react router
save this as a production dependency (ie b/c using npm and not npx)

$ npm i react-router-dom -S
enter

then go package.json file to see the depenedencies
including react-router-dom included in the dependencies

package.json

{
  "name": "16tut",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.14.1",
    "@testing-library/react": "^11.2.7",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.8.3",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0",			<<<<<<<<<<<<<HERE
    "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
    "web-vitals": "^1.1.2"
    },
}


now close the package.json file

to clear out a react application you need to delete all the files in src except for

App.js
index.css
index.js

Then go into index.js
and remove the comments from line 13 onwards so only left with code on lines 1-11
and also remove the import for WebVitals as well				v 04.45.54
