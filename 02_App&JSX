Explore App component (default component created by a new React project)
Explore JSX, what is it, what you can do within it?

Start by looking at Create React App then creates an index.js file
$ node -v
$ npx create-react-app 01tut

inside index.js 
we import our App from the App file b/c each component gets its own file
		import App from './App';

inside ReactDOM.render{}
our <App /> is injected into the DOM
and is being into the element that has the id = 'root'
		document.getElementById('root')

So now lets look at the App component which is App.js
inside App.js

		import logo from './logo.svg';
		import './App.css';
		fuction App(){}
make changes to this file and those edits will make automatic updates 
that are rendered on screen on right

		function App() {
		  return (
		    <div className="App">
		      <header className="App-header">
		        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
		        <p>
		          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to see changes.
		        </p>
		        <a
		          className="App-link"
		          href="https://reactjs.org"
		          target="_blank"
		          rel="noopener noreferror"
		        >
		          Learn React
		        </a>
		      </header>
		    </div>
		  )

		}

change text here
		          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to see changes.
		          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to what I change.
renders the changed text on the right

Now looking at our App component
its allowed to import resources so we import image as a logo
also import a css that goes with the app component
		import './App.css';
then notice the component is a function
		function App() {}
