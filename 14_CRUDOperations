Summary - 
1) we put a fetchItems function 
using an async await anonymous function
and the fetch API
inside of the useEffect Hook
in our App component
and this functional App component is the parent component 
for the rest of the components in our application
2) we simulated a call to an API using a 2 second setTimeout
but we are really running a local JSON server instance
and we are accessing the data from our db.json file.

So we have this code.
We request the data from the API 
Now we need to link up the rest of the CRUD operations
Create for creating a listItem
Read for reading a listItem
Update for updating a listItem
Delete for deleting a listItem

  useEffect(() => {

    // CRUD - Read
    const fetchItems = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(API_URL);
	if (!response.ok) throw Error('Did not receive expected data');
        const listItems = await response.json();
        // console.log(listItems);		// can delete was useful for debugging
        setItems(listItems);
        setFetchError(null)
      } catch (err) {
        // console.log(err.message)		// can delete was useful for debugging
        setFetchError(err.message);
      }	finally {
	setIsLoading(false)
      }
    }
    setTimeout(() => {
      (async () => await fetchItems())();	
    }, 2000)

  }, [])


So lets go ahead and put CrUD in place as well. (r is done).

App.js

import Header from './Header';
import SearchItem from './SearchItem';
import AddItem from './AddItem';
import Content from './Content';
import Footer from './Footer';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3500/items';

  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [newItem, setNewItem] = useState('');
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');
  const [fetchError, setFetchError] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

Need add a file to the src folder   	apiRequest.js
this will contain a function that we can import to use
for all of these other operations (Create, Update, Delete)
so here we abstract somewhat to allow us to us this 1 function
for all 3 operations

define the name const apiRequest
it will be an asyc function
that accepts a url
we will use a default parameter for now that is just an empty string
then it is going to accept a 2nd parameter 
called an optionsObject
and this optionsOjb will be set to null 	= null
this will have a 3rd parameter errMsg
and this will be set to null
the we put in the arrow for the arrow function and curly braces {}
and we also need to remember to export this function so at the bottom
we add export default apiRequest;

const apiRequest = 
const apiRequest = async ()
const apiRequest = async (url = )
const apiRequest = async (url = '')
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj)
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null)
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = )
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null)
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
}
const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
}

export default apiRequest;


now with the setup done, lets start the component's body
we start with a try block 		try {}
and the setup inside the try block would also include a catch {}
for an error			(err)
and then it will have a finally at the end that happens whether we
have an error or not.


const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {}
}

export default apiRequest;


const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {}

    catch ()
}


const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {}

    catch (err) {}
}

const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {
    
    } catch (err) {

    } finally {

    }
}

export default apiRequest;


now we have our try catch finally block, lets define the generic requests
which defines the response we expect to receive inside the try block
we set that equal to await fetch
and we use the url here
and fetch also accepts a 2nd parameter which is an optionsObj
this optionsObj is the 2nd parameter that was originally part of the apiRequest function
so we accept both of those 		;
Note that the optionsObj is what differentiates this addressing which amoung the choices of
Create vs Update vs Delete request.

        const response
        const response = await
        const response = await fetch
        const response = await fetch(url,
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj)
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);

so now we have 

const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);
    
    } catch (err) {

    } finally {

    }
}

export default apiRequest;



after the const response statement, we check to see if
the url response is ok or not.
This is a lot like our fetch function from the useEffect of the App component.
This is say !response.ok (ie if the response is not correct) then we want to catch it
and throw an Error b/c this will not be automatically caught as a error (ie its a
response that we did not want)
and so here we add the text 'Please reload the app'
We add this text b/c at this point the state of the application may not be in sync
with the database. So we reload, get the data back from the server once again, and then
our state will be updated once again to be in sync with the server.
So this is why we add the 'Please reload' message here.


        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);
	if (!response.ok)    
	if (!response.ok) throw 
	if (!response.ok) throw Error()
	if (!response.ok) throw Error('Please reload the app);

so now we have 

const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);
	if (!response.ok) throw Error('Please reload the app);    
    } catch (err) {

    } finally {

    }
}

export default apiRequest;


then we need to define the error message in the catch block
we set the error message equal to 		=
err.message

         errMsg
         errMsg = 
         errMsg = err.message;

and then in the finally block, this is where we
want to return the error message
so no matter what, this return will happen whether the
message is null or it actually has a value
and we dont need a response back from the API here		if (!response.ok) throw Error('Please reload the app);    
and the reason we dont need those reponses back is b/c
we are updating the state with our setItems and other set functions
that we would call from our state, however, that does not update the API
and we need to keep the state of our application and the API in sync  v03.50.26
but we can update the state and see that update occur faster 
than we may get that response back from the API 
so we dont want to wait for that response 
we would rather instantly show the new state in the application 
but then if we get an error message then we know we are out of sync
with the API so then we show 'Please reload the app' message
(or whatever other error might occur that is caught by the catch (err) block

         return errMsg;

so now we have our apiRequest

const apiRequest = async (url = '', optionsObj = null, errMsg = null) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, optionsObj);
	if (!response.ok) throw Error('Please reload the app);    
    } catch (err) {
         errMsg = err.message;
    } finally {
         return errMsg;
    }
}

export default apiRequest;


now lets go back to the App component and import our apiRequest
so we import apiRequest from apiRequest

App.js

import Header from './Header';
import SearchItem from './SearchItem';
import AddItem from './AddItem';
import Content from './Content';
import Footer from './Footer';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import apiRequest from './apiRequest';

so far we have
1) defined the apiRequest
2) imported apiRequest into our App.js component
3) put apiRequest to work and the first place we could use it is within the addItem function 
and note that 
(3a) we already have everything we need to udpate our state in setItems 
but this is not enough b/c 
(3b) we need to update the REST API as well and we do this inside the new function postOptions b/c
this will a post request

from App.js
const addItem = (item) => {
  const id = items.length ? items[items.length -1].id + 1 : 1;
  const myNewItem = { id, checked: false, item };
  const listItems = [...items, myNewItem];
  setItems(listItems);							

  const postOptions

Lets discuss building the postOptions function
This will be a post request.
Set this equal to 	=
an object		{}
Lets define the method 		method:
and that will be POST		'POST'
and after the method 		,
We define the headers which an object all of its own
This is an object 	{}
and inside the headers, we define the 'Content-Type'
and this will be 'application/json'
Then we a comma after headers		},
and then we need to define the body	body:
Now for the body, the information we want to send
We need to use JSON.stringify
and here we can pass in (myNewItem) as we defined it above
Note here in myNewItem we dont need 
to send the full list of items like we did when we set the items in our state
So we just need the myNewItem that we want to POST to the REST API
and this was defined by myNewItem
so with that, we have completed our postOptions.


  const postOptions
  const postOptions = 
  const postOptions = {}

  const postOptions = {
    method:
  }

  const postOptions = {
    method: 'POST'
  }

  const postOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
  }

  const postOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: 
  }

  const postOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type':
    }
  }

  const postOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json
    },
  }

  const postOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json
    },
    body: 
  }

  const postOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(newMyItem)
  }


so now lets define the rest of and send the request
so we have const result
equals  	=
now remember this result is await and remember that our apiRequest was an async function
so, we need to change our const addItem to an async
  const addItem = (item) => {
  const addItem = async (item) => {
and now that addItem is async, we can add await to the result function		const result = await
like this, we add await to the apiRequest
and we can pass in the API_URL that we defined at the top
  const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3500/items';
and so for a POST request, we dont need to do anything different other than
just send it to the same api url that we send the get request to
BUT the method being different will therefore handle the request differently
so this is a POST apiRequest and the url will not change
We also need to pass in 			, 
the postOptions 
add ; to end the statement
Now, if you remember our apiRequest, that it returns is an errMsg
either its null or its not (ie errMsg)
So we can add an if statement to check
if we have a result (ie result exists) which means the message is not null
Then we need to setFetchError
and of course when that is not null 
(ie result exists)   		setFetchError(result)
then it will render in our Chrome app 
  const result = await apiRequest(API_URL, postOptions);
  if (result) setFetchError(result);

  const postOptions = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(newMyItem)
  }

  const result
  const result =
  const result = await
  const result = await apiRequest
  const result = await apiRequest()
  const result = await apiRequest(API_URL)
  const result = await apiRequest(API_URL, )
  const result = await apiRequest(API_URL, postOptions);
  const result = await apiRequest(API_URL, postOptions);
  if (result)
  if (result) setFetchError
  if (result) setFetchError(result);

so lets save this

  const result = await apiRequest(API_URL, postOptions);
  if (result) setFetchError(result);

Open VSCode terminal to show already running JSON server 
need to see details to see GET requests			v03.54.40

Notice we have many GET 304 
lets reload the Chrome app
we get a GET 304 means its using cached info (not need to get
info from the server b/c nothing has changed)
200 range response means ok

What happens if we post? ie lets add an items using the app buttons
add in text box Cookies
click the plus button
in Terminal this shows a POST /items 201 55.542 ms
This works as we expected    
 
Lets open data folder
open db.json file
before we had 3 items, now we have 4 items including Cookies
add to our json file, so this 
did update the file as expected
did handle the request as expected

{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "checked": false,
      "item": "Almonds, Unsalted, in the blue bag"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "checked": false,
      "item": "Pizza"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "checked": false,
      "item": "Bread"
    }
    {
      "id": 4,
      "checked": false,
      "item": "Cookies"
    }
  ]
}

now lets go back to App.js component
and handle the Check now
const handleCheck = (id) => {
    const listItems = items.map((item) => item.id === id ? { ... item, checked: !item.checked } : item);
    setAndSaveItems(listItems);
}
we already have the code that updates our state
    setAndSaveItems(listItems);

so we add new code below this
lets define the item that is getting updated
so far we handled the listItems and 				    const listItems =
then we updated the full state of the listItems	    		    setAndSaveItems(listItems);
and we just changed the check: !item.checked 
but now we need to handle this just a little differently
how?
we need to get the item that is checked
    const myItem
and now we can use listItems b/c we have already updated the listItems 
and now 'the checked' is in the state that it needs to be
so here we use listItems
and we use filter
we pass in 
the item
use an anonymous function arrow
and say the item.id needs to be equal to the id that was passed in
if we do this, we have now defined myItem

    const myItem = listItems
    const myItem = listItems.filter
    const myItem = listItems.filter()	
    const myItem = listItems.filter(())			second set of () added for consistency with handleCheck
    const myItem = listItems.filter(item)
    const myItem = listItems.filter(item => )
    const myItem = listItems.filter(item => id);

so we have

const handleCheck = (id) => {
    const listItems = items.map((item) => item.id === id ? { ... item, checked: !item.checked } : item);
    setAndSaveItems(listItems);

    const myItem = listItems.filter(item => id);
}

now we need to define updateOptions				v03.57.53
b/c we are going to update (not posting) 

const handleCheck = (id) => {
    const listItems = items.map((item) => item.id === id ? { ... item, checked: !item.checked } : item);
    setAndSaveItems(listItems);

    const myItem = listItems.filter(item => id);
    updateOptions
}


so the CRUD method we use is called PATCH
so we set this equal to =
an object {} 
and here we define the method: ''
called PATCH
b/c we are updating a specific part of a specific record
now once again the in the headers: {}
this will be just like before
we add 'Content-Type':					'Content-Type': 
and this will equal 'application/json'			'application/json'
now that we have defined the headers we add },		},
we will move down and define the body:			body:

    updateOptions
    updateOptions = 
    updateOptions = {}
    updateOptions = {
      method: ''
    }

    updateOptions = {
      method: 'PATCH'
    }

    updateOptions = {
      method: 'PATCH'
      headers: {}
    }

    updateOptions = {
      method: 'PATCH'
      headers: {
        'Content-Type':
      }
    }

    updateOptions = {
      method: 'PATCH'
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
    }

    updateOptions = {
      method: 'PATCH'
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        body: JSON.stringify
      },
    }

and here once again we need to use JSON.stringify	JSON.stringify
and we can pass in					()
a specific bit of JSON here 				{}
just the checked property of this specific item 
that we are sending with the PATCH method		checked: 
and its called myItem					myItem
but remember that the filter returns an array
so its an array with one item so we must say [0]	myItem[0]
then we add a .						.
and then checked b/c whatever the checked property is	checked
we are not changing the checked property b/c it was
already updated before we accessed the listItems in this code
    const listItems = items.map((item) => item.id === id ? { ... item, checked: !item.checked } : item);
    const myItem = listItems.filter((item) => item.id === id);

and so this code will handle that execution by sending in the correct information  v03.59.19

and now that we have defined that object add the ; 		};
to close the const updateOptions method
and now we move on

        body: JSON.stringify
        body: JSON.stringify()
        body: JSON.stringify({})
        body: JSON.stringify({ checked: })
        body: JSON.stringify({ checked: myItem})
        body: JSON.stringify({ checked: myItem[0]})
        body: JSON.stringify({ checked: myItem[0].})
        body: JSON.stringify({ checked: myItem[0].checked})
        body: JSON.stringify({ checked: myItem[0].checked})

    updateOptions = {
      method: 'PATCH'
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
        body: JSON.stringify({ checked: myItem[0].checked})
    };


so our complete const handleCheck method is

const handleCheck = (id) => {
    const listItems = items.map((item) => item.id === id ? { ... item, checked: !item.checked } : item);
    setAndSaveItems(listItems);

    const myItem = listItems.filter(item => id);
    updateOptions = {
      method: 'PATCH'
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
        body: JSON.stringify({ checked: myItem[0].checked})
    };
}


now we need to request the url b/c this is just a little different
than the url that we used for GET and POST
this will be equal to a template literal		''	${}
and we start with that API_URL				API_URL
but after that we need a slash inside the template literal	/
still part of the template literal			${}
and then we need to use whatever id was passed in	id
so if this was POST #1 it would have the id of 1
so we are accessing a specific post that we are updating with PATCH	v03.59.52

and then we define our result again		const result = 
we set this equal to an await call 
which means we need to change the handleCheck to an async function as well

const handleCheck = (id) => {
const handleCheck = async (id) => {
 
then we add await
and add apiRequest()
and we pass in a (reqUrl)
and also pass in the ( , updateOptions)
and now once again the apiRequest will only return the error message
and that error message is either null or it has a value
so we say if we have a result			if (result)

 
	
    const reqURL = 
    const reqURL = ``
    const reqURL = `${}`
    const reqURL = `${API_URL}`
    const reqURL = `${API_URL}/`
    const reqURL = `${API_URL}/${}`
    const reqURL = `${API_URL}/${id}`

    const result = 
    const result = await
    const result = await apiRequest()
    const result = await apiRequest(reqUrl)
    const result = await apiRequest(reqUrl,)
    const result = await apiRequest(reqUrl, updateOptions);
    if (result)
